# Server side development with ktor and kotlin

This is the version 2 repo I use in my kotlin talk about ktor for the Belgian Kotlin User Group.

It is a simple web api with room for improvement. Feel free to use this as a guide in your own kotlin talk(s) about ktor.

The idea
Suppose you're boss wants you to create a web api that holds Countries. It would be nice to expose this as a web api to use in all his applications of the company, so we do not need to create a countries api for each application.

The api
This api uses ktor as the backbone together with Jetbrains Exposed and an H2 database.

The future
I will add a Docker file so I can demo the application easily.
